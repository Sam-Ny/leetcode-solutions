# 🚀 LeetCode Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice Showcase** — a public summary of my problem‑solving journey, coding consistency, and algorithm mastery.  
All actual solution code is stored safely in a **private GitHub repository**, synced automatically using LeetSync.

## 🧠 Topics I Practice Regularly

| Category             | Skills Gained |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **SQL / PL/SQL**    | Joins, Window functions, CTEs, Subqueries, Stored Procedures/Packages, Indexing, Performance tuning |
| Arrays, Hashing     | Sliding window, prefix sums |
| Two Pointers        | Fast/slow pointer logic |
| Trees & Graphs      | DFS, BFS, recursion |
| Dynamic Programming | Memoization, tabulation |
| Greedy Algorithms   | Optimization strategies |
| Binary Search       | Pattern-based solving |

## 🗂 How This Works (Automation Flow)

Every time I solve a LeetCode problem:

**LeetCode → LeetSync → GitHub (private repo)**

This automation helps me maintain:
- Consistency in solving problems  
- A structured learning archive  
- Transparent tracking of coding activity  
- Continuous improvement in foundational skills

## 🔐 Why Code is Private?

LeetCode problems and solutions fall under content protection and copyright rules.  
Keeping the code private helps avoid:
- Copyright violations  
- Plagiarism concerns  
- Company laptop policy conflicts  

I’m happy to discuss solutions or walk through my approach during interviews.
