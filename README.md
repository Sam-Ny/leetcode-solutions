# 🚀 LeetCode Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice Showcase** — a public summary of my problem‑solving journey, coding consistency, and algorithm mastery.  
All actual solution code is stored safely in a **private GitHub repository**, synced automatically using LeetSync.

## 🧠 Topics I Practice Regularly

| Category             | Skills Gained |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **SQL / PL/SQL**    | Joins, Window functions, CTEs, Subqueries, Stored Procedures/Packages, Indexing, Performance tuning

I'll be adding more to above list gradually.

> 🎯 **Current Focus:** Strengthening **SQL & PL/SQL** for data engineering roles and technical interviews.

## 🗂 How This Works (Automation Flow)

Every time I solve a LeetCode problem:

**LeetCode → LeetSync → GitHub (private repo)**

This automation helps me maintain:
- Consistency in solving problems  
- A structured learning archive  
- Transparent tracking of coding activity  
- Continuous improvement in foundational skills

## 🔐 Why Code is Private?

LeetCode problems and solutions fall under content protection and copyright rules.  
Keeping the code private helps avoid:
- Copyright violations  
- Plagiarism concerns  
- Company laptop policy conflicts  

I’m happy to discuss solutions or walk through my approach during interviews.
